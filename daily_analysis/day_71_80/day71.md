# Day 71
Continued working on my [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sergio.fidanli/viz/2022NFLSeasonSummaryWeeks1-16/Summary?publish=yes) today. Updates:

1. Added a TE dashboard that takes the same layout as WRs
2. Added the TE dashboard to the Story so that a user can select a dashboard for each skill position
3. Added `Total Receiving TDs` metric to the WR and TE dashboard. This was an oversight and should have been there when I first created the dashboards.
