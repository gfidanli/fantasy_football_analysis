# Day 55
Traveling today so the easiest thing for me to do was to work on my 2022 NFL Summary Dashboard in Tableau. Today I worked on the Wide Receiver Dashboard and I quite like it. Some things I added that I'll need to consider adding for the others are:

- Ranking filter for the Total Fantasy Points treemap
  - Having this is useful if you want more detail for the top X players
- Percentile filter for the bar chart
  - The number of WRs is larger than RBs so I think it's useful to only look at a subset, like the top 25% of a given metric. That really lets someone see the difference between the very top performers and just the good ones.
