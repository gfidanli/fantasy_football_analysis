    "Today I continued my work from yesterday. My main goal was to quantify the percentage of top finishes which I've defined as a player drafted in the first round of a X-team league who ended up finishing in the top X in fantasy points. So if a player was drafted in the first round of 10-team leagues for 4 seasons, and finished top 10 in fantasy points 3 out of 4 seasons, that player would have a top finish 75% of the time.\n",
