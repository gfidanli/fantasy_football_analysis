    "# Day 32 Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "I came across an interesting [article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2022/11/14/dolphins-hard-rock-sun-shade/) the other day talking about the design of Miami's football stadium. When the Miami stadium was renovated between 2015 and 2016, engineers strategically planned to point the sun directly on the opponent’s sideline for the entire game while the home team’s sideline sat in the shade. During the warmest months of the NFL season, temperature differences between the home and away team sidelines can get up to 30 degrees F!  \n",
    "\n",
    "Naturally, I want to use data to see if this \"advantage\" really makes a difference. I'll start with finding the winning percentage at home for all teams since 1999 since I have that data available."
