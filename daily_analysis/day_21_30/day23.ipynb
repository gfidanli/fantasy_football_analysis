    "Use NFL play-by-play data from 1999 to create a dataset at the game-team level where I can see the score and the number of different types of scoring plays each team had that made up their final score. Ultimately I want to compare the percentage of score by offense/defense to see how teams perform and if there are any outliers at the weekly, team, or season level.\n",

    "Today's update:\n",
    "- Did a sanity check on a number of columns, making sure that extreme values made sense based on description of the play\n",
    "- Figured out that the play-by-play dataset is missing 59 games across the 1999-2022 seasons. I didn't filter out any games in the API call so I might need to manually check data in the [nflverse repository](https://github.com/nflverse/nflverse-data)\n",
    "\n",
    "Current challenges:\n",
    "- See if I can find data on the missing 59 games\n",
    "- Confirm if data is indeed missing or something is wrong with the data call on my end\n",
    "- Check score distribution. Confirm zero scores\n",
    "\n",
    "Solutions:\n",
    "- Run histograms and utilize frequencies\n",
    "- Check a few sample cases of rare scoring plays and see if my code places them in the right category\n",
    "- Update JOIN logic to FULL JOIN"
