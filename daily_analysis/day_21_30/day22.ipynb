    "Use NFL play-by-play data from 1999 to create a dataset at the game-team level where I can see the score and the number of different types of scoring plays each team had that made up their final score. Ultimately I want to compare the percentage of score by offense/defense to see how teams perform and if there are any outliers at the weekly, team, or season level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today's update:\n",
    "- Updated the play-by-play query for the initial data pull as well as minor data cleaning\n",
    "- Was able to check each team's score for each game against the schedules table. **Scores match 100%** so my manual calculation is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "Current challenges:\n",
    "- Need to do a sanity check on the frequency of different scoring plays to make sure that I didn't count an offensive TD as a defensive TD or something similar\n",
    "\n",
    "Solutions:\n",
    "- Run histograms and utilize frequencies\n",
    "- Check a few sample cases of rare scoring plays and see if my code places them in the right category"
