    "Use NFL play-by-play data from 1999 to create a dataset at the game-team level where I can see the score and the number of different types of scoring plays each team had that made up their final score. Ultimately I want to compare the percentage of score by offense/defense to see how teams perform and if there are any outliers at the weekly, team, or season level.\n",

    "Today's update:\n",
    "- Figured out why I was missing games. I was performing a LEFT JOIN where my left dataset were teams that scored at least one passing, rushing, or return touchdown on offense. This was incorrect and left out games where a team scored zero points, just a field goal, or other conditions.\n",
    "- Figured out that the play-by-play dataset is missing only 3 games across the 1999-2022 seasons. I didn't filter out any games in the API call so I might need to manually check data in the [nflverse repository](https://github.com/nflverse/nflverse-data). Still, if I'm aggregating by season, 3 games isn't a significant issue when it comes to any statistcal analysis I might want to do in the future."
