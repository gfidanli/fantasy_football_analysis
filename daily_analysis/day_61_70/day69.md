# Day 69
Starting to feel the fatigue and lack of motivation given the holiday season but I made a commitment to do 100 days of coding and I'm going to keep going no matter what. To change things up and stay motivated, I'm going to revisit my [Tableau Public dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/2022NFLSeasonSummaryWeeks1-16/Summary?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) that summarizes the 2022 NFL Season. I made the following updates:

1. Updated the dataset to include data through Week 16 of the 2022 NFL season.
2. Added the passing yards/passing TD efficiency statistic to the `QB Pick Metric` dropdown.
3. Updated tooltips to make more sense.
4. Updated the coloring for bar charts so they all match. They should all separate the data into three groups by using different hues of blue.
5. Added `Avg Receiving Yards` and `Avg Rushing Yards` to the `WR Pick Metric` and `RB Pick Metric` dropdowns, respectively.

Tomorrow I'll continue working on the dashboard with my main focus being to make the RB dashboard look more like the WR dashboard in terms of filters and placement of the filters. Currently, the WR dashboard has more filter options and I need to make them the same.
