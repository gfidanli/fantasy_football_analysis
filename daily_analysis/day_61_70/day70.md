# Day 70
Continued working on my [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sergio.fidanli/viz/2022NFLSeasonSummaryWeeks1-16/Summary?publish=yes) today. Updates:

1. Made RB Dashboard layout match the WR Dashboard
2. Added receiving yards to RB bar chart to look at RBs who get passing work
3. Added offensive snaps percentage to RB/WR bar chart to find players with the most opportunities to score points
